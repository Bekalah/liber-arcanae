## ✦ How to Use in Game
- Each character = one Tarot Major node, locked to its archetype.
- Each has:
  - Wolf Green soul path battle (psychological arc).
  - Strengths / Weaknesses (combat + art mechanics).
  - Witch-Mode power (special encounter ability).
- As you climb the Double Tree with 72 Shem gates, each encounter with a node tests you by that archetype’s battle.

✨ this gives you:
- Character sheets like in D&D, but infused with real canon work + soul astrology.
- Study tool: you can read them as case studies (Crowley = Catalyst, Fortune = Protector, etc).
- Playable factions: each Witch-Mode is a tactical specialty, not just lore.
