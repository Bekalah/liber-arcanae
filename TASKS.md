# Project Task List

## Working
- **Cosmic Helix Renderer**: Static, ND-safe HTML5 canvas renders Vesica grid, Tree-of-Life nodes/paths, Fibonacci curve, and double-helix lattice.
- **Offline Palette Loading**: Uses `data/palette.json` with graceful fallback.
- **Interface Schema Guard**: `npm test` validates sample interface data against JSON schema.

## To Do
- Implement additional art variants for Rebecca Respawn (illuminated manuscript, alchemical diagram, visionary scene, cinematic frame).
- Expand avatar system to allow style toggles for book, game, learning, and music modes.
- Create identity anchors for other archetypes (e.g., Miribelle Vespertine) before layering fusion overlays.
- Document best practices for ND-safe palettes and geometry constants.
