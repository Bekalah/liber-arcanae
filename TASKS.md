# Task List

## Working
- Cosmic Helix Renderer renders Vesica, Tree-of-Life, Fibonacci curve, and static helix lattice offline.
- Palette fallback keeps ND-safe colors without network requests.

## To Do
- Build avatar art system for Rebecca Respawn with Neo-Atelier style.
- Generate identity anchors for additional archetypes and daimon companions.
- Add book-ready art variants: illuminated plate, alchemical diagram, visionary scene, cinematic frame.
- Expose style toggles for adventure, learning, art, and music modes.
