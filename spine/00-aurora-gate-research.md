# 00 Â· Aurora Gate Research

Aurora Gate is the spine zero waypoint: a quiet vestibule before any traveller reaches the tarot labyrinth. The gate keeps dreamers grounded while they map Leonora Carrington&apos;s symbols into Codex 144:99 nodes.

## Field Observations

- **Entry Protocol:** Pause with three slow breaths (3). Note the seven (7) halo lights embedded in the walls and the nine (9) glyphs that respond to touch.
- **Data Capture:** Eleven (11) fiber threads weave across the ceiling. They mirror the twenty-two (22) tarot paths and broadcast telemetry to thirty-three (33) stabilizer stones.
- **Containment:** Ninety-nine (99) harmonic chimes maintain calm resonance. One-hundred forty-four (144) recorded anecdotes verify the gate&apos;s trauma-informed boundary.

## Research Tasks

1. Translate Carrington dream-creatures into the lattice without flattening them.
2. Link Leonora&apos;s pantheon scroll to the Vesica and Fibonacci layers so the atlas stays multi-dimensional.
3. Archive every iteration with provenance tags and consent notes.

## Output Routing

- Update `data/nodes.json` when a new aurora node crystallizes.
- Push static assets through the `npm run build` command so site/app remains synchronized.
- Store offline field recordings inside the service worker cache manifest.
