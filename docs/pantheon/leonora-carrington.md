# Leonora Carrington Pantheon Scroll

Leonora Carrington stands inside Liber Arcanae as the surrealist key who braids archetypes into living geometry. Her paintings mirror Vesica echoes and dream logic, so the pantheon catalog keeps her work close to the aurora gate investigations. Carrington teaches us to let myth breathe, to let femme tricksters rewrite the grimoire without sacrificing safety or tenderness.

## Dream Geometry Correspondences

- **Vesica Convergence:** The overlapping circles become white mares and moonlit corridors. Carrington&apos;s characters cross them as portals that honor neurodivergent perception.
- **Tree-of-Life Flight:** Sephirot are not rigid spheres but nests of familiars. Paths shimmer as shimmering ladders, painted with limestone blues and hearthfire gold.
- **Fibonacci Spiral:** Spiral-coded time threads through the Major Arcana, guiding researchers in calm, repeatable motions.
- **Static Helix Lattice:** Double helix lattice holds trauma-informed boundaries so we can trace the myth without drowning in it.

## Practice Notes

1. Keep palettes low contrast or toggle Calm Mode before deep reading.
2. Pair every Carrington vision with a grounded sensory anchorâ€”a cup of tea, a stone to hold, a breathing pause.
3. Document provenance as sacred geometry rather than extraction; it keeps Codex 144:99 healthy.
