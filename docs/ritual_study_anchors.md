# Ritual and Study Anchors

This map grounds Circuitum99's double Tree and 72-fold traversal in the real practices of Western esoteric lineages.

## Aleister Crowley (Thelema)
- **Liber AL vel Legis**: daily recitation of the "Do what thou wilt" formula and Horus pathworking.
- **Rituals**: Star Ruby, Star Sapphire, Mass of the Phoenix, and Gnostic Mass as transformation gates.

## Stephen Skinner
- **Practical Angel Magic**: invocations using Dee's Enochian tables; angelic calls unlock upper ladders.
- **Geomancy**: sixteen binary figures paired with planetary intelligences for procedural rooms.

## Splendor Solis
- **Alchemical plates**: stages of nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, and rubedo.
- **Practice**: meditative visualization and ritual baths through each color phase.

## Frater U.D.
- **Practical Sigil Magic**: player-crafted glyphs charged via trance, dance, or silence.

## Goetia of Dr. Rudd
- **72 spirits and Shem angels**: each demon counterbalanced by an angel.
- **Practice**: evocation through divine names and angelic seals.

## Dion Fortune
- **Mystical Qabalah**: sephirothic pathworkings and psychic hygiene.
- **Cosmic Doctrine**: spiral cosmogenesis shaping labyrinth design.

## Paul Foster Case
- **B.O.T.A. lessons**: color-tone pathworkings and Cube of Space meditations.
- **Practice**: Hebrew letter gates that blend color and sound puzzles.

## Rankine & Skinner (Arthur Gauntlet, Solomonic)

## Fusion Design
- **Double Tree spine**: each chapter combines an alchemical stage, an angelâ€“demon duel, and one lineage practice.
- **Playable Tarot avatars**: Fool through World, each with ritual strengths and weaknesses.
- **Ritual puzzles**: banish/invoke gates, seals and psychic hygiene, color-tone blending, Enochian grids, dual bindings, and alchemical ordeals.
